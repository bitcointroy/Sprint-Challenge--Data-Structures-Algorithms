Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method? O(n) - visits each node exactly once

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function? O(n) due to worst case skewed binary tree where height = n

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? O(n) - visits each node exactly once

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? O(n) due to worst case perfect binary tree

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function? O(log n) - derived from O(n + log n) 

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array? If creating a new array, the space complexity will be O(n). If we're altering the input array, it would be O(1) - linear! YAY!
